Problem statement:
https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification

<h3> Steps to start with this case study: </h3> <br> 
 1. Download the data from the link below 
 Data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/malware-classification/data
 <br>
 2. Extract the data.
 You can use the below code to install p7zip <br>
 !sudo apt install p7zip-full <br>
 
Then run the below code in the jupyter notebook to unzip files. <br>
!7z x train.7z


<h3> EDA notebook - </h3> 

 1. Understand the problem statement, metric we are using and the sample data for each of Byte and ASM files.
 2. Distribution of class labels in train and test data.

<h3> Byte files feature generation notebook - </h3>
 1. Analyzed the size of byte files. <br>
 2. Extract unigram features using custom vectorizer. <br>
 3. Extract bigram features using custom vectorizer. <br>
 
 
<h3> ASM files feature generation notebook - </h3>
  1. Count the number of prefixes, opcode, keywords, registers for each file using multi-processing. <br>
  2. Analyzed the size of ASM files. <br>
  3. Extract graph features using multi-processing. <br>
  4. Extract image features using multi-processing. (As suggested by 'say no to overfitting' in their video taking the pixel density values of first 800 values) <br>
 Multi-variate analysis of ASM features. <br>
 
 <h3> Modelling notebook - </h3>
  1. Multi-variate anaylsis on the final features. <br>
  2. Training XGBoost model on the final features. <br>
  3. Further possible improvements. <br>
